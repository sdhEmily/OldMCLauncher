title: Scrolls Celebration Cape!
---
To celebrate the release of Scrolls 1.0, everybody will sport the amazing Scrolls-themed cape in Minecraft for a short while! :) This is a temporary event that starts today (Thursday) and runs for 48 hours.

Scrolls is our second major game, get more info and try the demo here: [https://www.scrolls.com/demo](https://www.scrolls.com/demo)

Cheers!

(You can disable the cape in Options->Skin Preferences if you need to.)
