title: We need your art for our Minecraft Calendar!
---
Imagine getting your art in our 2014 Minecraft calendar, winning a heap of prizes, and helping raise money for [Block by Block](http://www.mojang.com/2012/09/mojang-and-un-presents-block-by-block/) – our collaboration with UN Habitat – in the process. It’s a massive win-win for everyone!

All you need to do is submit a piece of art by February 8th. Visit J!NX for more info: [http://www.jinx.com/design_contest_info.aspx?theme=5](http://www.jinx.com/design_contest_info.aspx?theme=5)
