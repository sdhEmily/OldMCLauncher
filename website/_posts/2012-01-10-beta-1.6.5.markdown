title: Minecraft Beta 1.6.5
---
There are some annoying bed bugs in multiplayer in this version, I’ll fix those next week.

1.6.5:

\* Tweaked the connection reading code a lot. Hopefully this helps.<br>
\* Changed the “limit framerate” option to a “framerate cap” option.<br>
\* Added “Advanced OpenGL” again<br>
\* Players riding anything or sleeping in anything will stop doing so when they leave the game now<br>
\* Removed the minecraft version number from the main game window. It’s still available in the title screen<br>
\* Fixed some entities appearing to fall through the ground repeatedly in multiplayer (some might still do so)<br>
\* Fixed the server sometimes thinking the player hit a corner when walking when they didn’t<br>
\* Fixed dropped damaged items vanishing after a single use after being picked up<br>
\* Fixed dropped items not getting ejected from blocks properly<br>
\* Fixed the achievements window rendering some graphics outside the clip window<br>
\* Fixed players saving while sneaking being loaded too high up<br>
\* Fixed shift+click transferring items causing a crash when the target container is full<br>
\* Fixed lighting updates sometimes not happening correctly<br>
\* Fixed the players health appearing to be full when entering/exiting the nether<br>
\* Fixed a couple of instances where beds would act strange in multiplayer, primarily the “already occupied” bug<br>
