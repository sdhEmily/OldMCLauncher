title: Submit cool t-shirt art to J!NX! Win awesome prizes!
---
Competition time! J!NX are looking for t-shirt illustrations that celebrate the “Unsung Heroes of Minecraft.” Forget about Creepers and Steve for this one: it’s about ocelots, iron golems, and sheep; the smaller guys that sometimes get forgotten. Another thing: JiNX have boosted the prize pool since the competition was first announced.

Visit [J!NX](https://www.jinx.com/pages/about-jinx) for the details. You have until June 3rd to submit your entries.
Good luck!
